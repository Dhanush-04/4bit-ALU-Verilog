# 4bit-ALU-Verilog

This project defines an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) module, a crucial component in digital systems for performing arithmetic and logical operations. The module takes two 4-bit inputs (A and B) and a 4-bit selection input (sel) to determine the operation to be executed. The outputs include a carry bit (c), a primary result (out1), and an additional result (out2).

The ALU supports the following operations based on the value of the sel input:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

Bitwise AND, OR, XOR

Left shift and right shift

Bitwise NOT

Greater than, equal to comparisons
